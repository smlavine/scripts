# File:        mypassmenu
# Options:     -1        Instead of prompting the user with dmenu, selects the
#                        top choice automatically.
#              -m        Only show passwords that match the provided regex.
#              -o        Instead of copying the selected password to the
#                        clipboard, prints to stdout with a newline.
# Description: Opens a stylized dmenu prompt with passwords to select
#              from. Passwords are sorted according to the weight
#              value attached to them in $weights. Each time a
#              password is used, its weight increases by one, so that
#              over time the most used passwords take the least amount
#              of time to choose from the dmenu prompt.
