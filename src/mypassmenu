# File:        mypassmenu
# Description: Opens a stylized dmenu prompt with passwords to select
#              from. Passwords are sorted according to the weight
#              value attached to them in $weights. Each time a
#              password is used, its weight increases by one, so that
#              over time the most used passwords take the least amount
#              of time to choose from the dmenu prompt.
