scripts
=======
These are various scripts that I use on my system. They are deployed by
[smlss](https://sr.ht/~smlavine/smlss).

All scripts are located in the ```src/``` directory.

To install the scripts, simply run ```make``` or ```make install```.

To uninstall the scripts, run ```make uninstall```.
